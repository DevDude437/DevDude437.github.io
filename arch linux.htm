<h1 align=Center><Using Arch Linux on a daily basis>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>Arch Linux is my daily computer OS. You might think it's impossible to do things daily on a Linux computer and that you need a Windows or Mac computer, but the truth is, you don't! Linux is a much better choice than Windows or Mac for many reasons. You control your data, you control updates, you know exactly what is running in the background, and if you install Arch, you get to use the command line quite a bit, which I love! If you aren't someone who's into using commands to access your computer via a terminal, Arch probably isn't for you and you should consider something like Linux Mint, which is more user friendly. But yes, you can use Linux on a daily basis! I needed to use Microsoft Office365 recently, and I was able to access everything via the web. It all worked flawlessly, and gave me some more privacy too.</p>
