<h1 align=Center><Using Arch Linux on a daily basis>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>Arch Linux is my daily computer OS. You might think it's impossible to do things daily on a Linux computer and that you need a Windows or Mac computer, but the truth is, you don't! Linux is a much better choice than Windows or Mac for many reasons. You control your data, you control updates, you know exactly what is running in the background, and if you install Arch, you get to use the command line quite a bit, which I love! If you aren't someone who's into using commands to access your computer via a terminal, Arch probably isn't for you and you should consider something like Linux Mint, which is more user friendly. But yes, you can use Linux on a daily basis! I needed to use Microsoft Office365 recently, and I was able to access everything via the web. It all worked flawlessly, and gave me some more privacy too. Also, with this cool software called OBS Studio, you can record your screen. It's a super useful open source recording tool great for recording meetings and things like that. And speaking of meetings, Jitsi Meet also works great on Linux too! If I need to do a meeting, Jitsi is my go to platform. But what if you need Zoom? Well, that works just as well on Linux too! So Linux really can be used every day by every day people like you and me. I think that using Linux gives you the control you want with all the compatibility. And if you do need Windows still, you can always dual boot Linux and Windows on a computer and have two operating systems for the jobs that really do require Windows.</p>
