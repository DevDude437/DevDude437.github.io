<h1 align=left><p>Ah, the wonderful world of Linux. You know, that hard to use computer operating system for computer geeks. But is it really? Not so much. Linux, which was developed by Linus Torvalds in the early 1990s, isn't as complex as it seems. More and more regular users are trying Linux, and realizing its actually a fairly easy to use operating system for computers. Its not as daunting as you might think. Linux can do everything your old computer can, all while staying more private and secure. And its not hard to use since there are a few good beginner distrobutions and many great distrobutions aimed at more tech-y people. So dive into this guide and learn why YOU should use Linux today!</p>

<h1 align=left><p>Many people don't want to use Linux because they think it is hard to install, hard to use, and there is no compatible software. All these assumptions are wrong. Linux is in fact pretty easy to install (if you choose a beginner friendly distro), quite easy to use, and most apps that work on Windows will work on Linux (except Microsoft apps, of course). Some people are afraid of messing around in the terminal and screwing up something. But if you choose a beginner friendly distrobution (like Linux Mint), you will rarely, if ever, interact with the terminal. Linux Mint's UI (user interface) is quite similar to Windows. If you click on the Windows (Meta) key on your keyboard or click on the little Linux Mint logo in the bottom left (where the traditional Window would be on Windows) a similar menu to Windows will pop up, showing you all your apps and your power menu, etc.</p>

<h1 align=left><p>Linux does NOT track you, spy on you, collect usage diagnostics, display advertisments to you, or control you. Instead Linux remains Free and Open Source, provides you with many useful applications and tools, protects your privacy, and is super secure. The best part is that all Linux distrobutions are completely FREE to install. So go ahead and take charge of your privacy and security by using Linux. You deserve a computer that works for you, not a computer that tracks and controls you.</p>
<h1 align=center><p>Installing Linux Mint on a Windows Computer</p>
<h1 align=left><p>Here's what you'll need;

A USB Flash Drive with a minimum of 4GB storage (10GB+ recommended)

Steps;
Important notice: before you begin, back up all files and important documents. Installing Linux wipes all data,  including files, photos, documents, and everything else. You need to have backups.

On your computer, go to
https://linuxmint.com/
And click on Download. Click on Cinnamon Edition and find the Download Mirror for your country (Canada). Click on the very first one for your country and download it to your computer. The file is about 3GB.

Then download Balena Etcher from
https://etcher.balena.io/
When you launch Balena Etcher, the first thing to do is select image. Click on it and from your downloads, select the Linux Mint ISO file you downloaded. Plug in the flash drive and it should appear in the select drive section. Then click on Flash! and wait for it to finish. This burns the ISO image onto the flash drive, since copying it onto the flash drive won't work.

Now get ready to install Linux
***Once again, Back up everything important! When Linux is flashed, ALL FILES, PHOTOS, AND PERSONAL DOCUMENTS WILL BE PERMANENTLY DELETED!!! THE ENTIRE OPERATING SYSTEM WILL BE DELETED! **(**Unless you are dual booting. That means running Linux and Windows on the same computer. More later.)


Power off the computer completely. Plug in the flash drive with it off.  Now, you need to boot into the BIOS. Press and hold the F2 key while the computer boots. (If your doing this on a Mac, press and hold the Alt key as the computer boots)
So turn on the computer and immediately press and hold the F2 key. You will be confronted with a scary looking menu. Don't panic. You will see at the very top, there are options like  Information, Main, Advanced, Security, Boot, and Exit. Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, navigate to the Boot tab. You should see Windows Boot Manager listed as number 1 and your USB drive as number 2. Use the up/down arrows on your keyboard to select your USB drive. Then use the F5 key to move it up in the list to be number 1 and Windows Boot Manager number 2. Use the F10 key to save and exit. Press enter to confirm.
You will now see a black screen. The first option should be start Linux Mint Cinnamon 22.2 (or whatever the latest version is). Press enter on that one. Linux will boot from the flash drive (slowly).  You can now explore it a bit and when you are ready to install it, double click on the install button in the top right corner.

Installing is super simple. Just follow the steps in the installer. On the 'Install Multimedia Codecs page, make sure to check the box, otherwise videos and music won't be able to play.
When you get to the installation part (where it asks if you want to do a dual boot, or erase everything and install just Linux Mint) choose what you want to do. Erase disk and install Linux Mint will make Mint the only operating system on the computer. All data from Windows will be lost! Back up everything! This is recommended. If you still need Windows, click Install Mint alongside Windows Boot Manager. Your data should be retained! Still back up everything first! If you choose this option, when you turn on your computer, you can choose between Linux Mint and Windows. Pick the option you like and proceed.

At the end, it will say, installation complete. You can continue testing Mint, but until you restart your computer, any changes you make or documents you create won't be saved.
Click on the reboot button.

When your computer boots, one of two things will happen. If you erased the disk (recommended) and installed Linux, Linux will boot right away. If you dual booted Linux and Windows, you will be presented with a Terminal like window. There may be many options. The first one should say 'Linux Mint Cinnamon'. Enter on that to enter Linux. Somewhere farther down in the list, you should see 'Windows Boot Manager'. Use the arrow keys to select this and then enter. This will start Windows.
            Enabling WiFi for the first time
To enable WiFi, you may or may not need to do this step. I would do it just to check. You need a wired internet connection to be able to connect wirelessly. So this can be either an Ethernet connection or USB tethering via a charging cable from your phone. Go to the Linux Start menu, or press the Windows (Meta) key on your keyboard. Search for 'Driver Manager'. Launch it. It will check for Drivers to install. When this is done, you can try connecting to WiFi wirelessly.

And thats it. You've successfully installed Linux Mint! So now you can explore the apps and play around with it. The office suite included is free to use and it is fully compatible with Microsoft. So this means you can make a document or PDF on your Linux computer and if you share it with someone it will open in Microsoft Word for them. Or if someone makes a document in Word and shares it with you, you can open it in the office suite.</p>
