<h1 align=center><p>2025 has come and gone, and 2026 has arrived. I've gathered up a list of some of my favourite apps this year. These are all FOSS apps available from F Droid and/or GitHub. I hope you find many of these apps interesting.</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>AirGuard. This app detects Apple Airtags, Google Find My, and other tracking devices and notifies you if it detects a tracker is tracking you. It can also detect the tracker, so you can disable it.</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>Private Lock. This app detects movement, and it will lock your phone if it is dropped or moved to fast. You can set the sensitivity of the app in the settings.</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>Feedflow. An RSS reader. You can add news sources and read them all in one convenient place.</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>Automation. Perform lots of tasks and automate stuff on your device. Automation can do stuff like text somebody when you reach a certain location, perform an action if your battery drops below a certain amount, and more.</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>Audile. Want an open source replacement for Shazam? This is it. Audile has all the functionality of Shazam, but its FOSS.</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><Inter Profile Sharing. Have multiple profiles on your phone but don't know an easy way to transfer data between them? Inter Profile Sharing is for you. It let's you easily move things between your profiles.</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>VLC. The play anything and everything media player. You name the format, VLC can play it!</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=center><p>Those are my top apps from 2025. I hope you enjoy them and find many of them useful!</p>
