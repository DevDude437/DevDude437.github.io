<h1 align=center><p>2025 has come and gone, and 2026 has arrived. I've gathered up a list of some of my favourite apps this year. These are all FOSS apps available from F Droid and/or GitHub. I hope you find many of these apps interesting.</p>

<h1 align=left><p>AirGuard. This app detects Apple Airtags, Google Find My, and other tracking devices and notifies you if it detects a tracker is tracking you. It can also detect the tracker, so you can disable it.</p>

<h1 align=left><p>Private Lock. This app detects movement, and it will lock your phone if it is dropped or moved to fast. You can set the sensitivity of the app in the settings.</p>

<h1 align=left><p>Feedflow. An RSS reader. You can add news sources and read them all in one convenient place.</p>
