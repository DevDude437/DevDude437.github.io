<h1 align=center>The Ultimate Guide To GrapheneOS - A Private and Secure Android Operating System</h1>
<h3 align=center><A HREF="index.htm">GO TO HOME PAGE</A>
<h1 align=left><p>Meet GrapheneOS. The most private and secure operating system for your cell phone. GrapheneOS is degoogled by default, which means there are no Google services at all, anywhere on the phone. This ensures ultimate security, since Google can't track you. First, we'll look at your current phone and how it tracks you, and then we'll look at how GrapheneOS is different and how it protects you. Lets get started.</p>

<h1 align=center><p>Your Current Phone - Its More Than A Phone</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>Most of us use iPhones and Android phones on a daily basis. We use apps, play games, browse the web, use social media, make calls, and much more. But your current phone is doing more than you should be letting it. From AI scanning your photos and files, apps tracking you, and apps having crazy permissions they don't actually need, your phone is a regular spy - on your life. Privacy policies that aren't private, Ads targeted at you by what you watch and look up, and more things going on behind the scenes. Your phone isn't just a brick sitting on the counter. It knows your personal life and everything stored on your phone. You don't need to keep living like this. Meet GrapheneOS, the private and secure mobile Android - based operating system with absolutely NO tracking or spying.</p>

<h1 align=center><p>GrapheneOS - A Mobile Phone OS Come True</p>
<BR>
<h1 align=left><p>GrapheneOS is an open source phone operating system based on AOSP (The Android Open Source Project). By default, it has no Google apps or services, and no tracking. You can install open source apps from open source app stores like F Droid and Aurora Store. F Droid is a whole collection of FOSS (Free and Open Source) apps. Aurora Store gives you anonymous access to the Google Play Store (so you can use it without a Google Account). You can install Google Play services if you desire, and use regular apps too. Here are some of the best features of GrapheneOS. First theres Storage Scopes. Heres how they work. Say you download a messaging app (Telegram or Whatsapp for example). The app asks for permission to access your photos and videos so you can send them to people. Click on 'enable Storage Scopes'. Now, the app thinks you gave it the permission, when you actually didn't. So now it can only access the photos you choose to send, instead of your entire photo library. Beat that, Apple and Google! In addition, you also have Contact Scopes, which serve the same purpose as Storage Scopes, but for your contacts. You can also deny internet access to apps, completely cutting them off from the internet if they don't require it to run. Plus, you can install some neat apps like NewPipe. NewPipe is an open source YouTube client. You don't need a Google Account, you can download videos to watch offline, subscirbe to channels, and there are NO Ads! So its basically a YouTube Premium experience for free, all while respecting your privacy. I'll make a list of the best apps to install on GrapheneOS and where to download them from. Currently, the only supported phones to install GrapheneOS on are Google Pixel Phones (no other phone will work, don't try, you may wreck your phone). As of this writing, supported devices are the Pixel 6 Series, 7 Series, 8 Series, 9 Series, and the 10 Series. Read all the articles on the official website for more information.</p>
